### Dataset:  

1) RowNumber: corresponds to the record (row) number and has no effect on the output.  
2) CustomerId: contains random values and has no effect on customer leaving the bank.  
3) Surname: the surname of a customer has no impact on their decision to leave the bank.  
4) CreditScore: can have an effect on customer churn, since a customer with a higher credit score is less likely to leave the bank.  
5) Geography: a customer’s location can affect their decision to leave the bank.  
6) Gender: it’s interesting to explore whether gender plays a role in a customer leaving the bank.  
7) Age: this is certainly relevant, since older customers are less likely to leave their bank than younger ones.
